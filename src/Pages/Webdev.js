                A big Yes, to the question. Web development never goes out of
                business. If you become a good web developer, you can earn a
                pretty good amount and learn so many new things every day that
                can improve your skills more and more. Web development is worth
                it if you are passionate about it

                <h2>ABOUT WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>
                  Web development is the building and maintenance of websites;
                  it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website
                  look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user
                  experience. Web development skills are in high demand
                  worldwide and well paid too â€“ making development a great
                  career option
                  <br></br>The field of web development is generally broken down
                  into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server
                  side). Let's delve into the details.

                    A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and
                    interactivity using <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</b> . They
                    take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into
                    reality.

                    The backend developer engineers deal with what is going on
                    behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored, and
                    without this data, there would be no frontend.
